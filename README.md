# Practical-Machine-Learning-Notes
[*Practical Machine Learning with Python: A Problem-Solverâ€™s Guide to Building Real-World Intelligent Systems*](practical-machine-learning-python-problem-solvers.pdf)

This repository contains the practical machine learning projects in this book. I have implemented various machine learning algorithms and techniques in theis code. 
The projects showcase my understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The study notes include detailed explanations of various machine learning concepts and hands-on examples.
